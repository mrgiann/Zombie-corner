# Zombie-corner
Zombie Corner is a website that I started developing when I was in my early stages of learning programming. Although I initially left it unfinished, I have recently reworked it and it is now complete. However, it is important to note that this page does not have all the functionality and features that would be expected from a fully developed page. Instead, it serves as a reflection of my programming journey and shows how I've progressed since my first attempts.
